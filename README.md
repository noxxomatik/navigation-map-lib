# navigation-map-lib
JavaScript library to visualize and convert data of an inertial measurement unit for navigation.

Initially intended to visualize the sensor data of an OpenROV in its cockpit application (extended OpenROV software to gather all available IMU data: https://github.com/noxxomatik/openrov-software-arduino-30.0.4-BNO055). 

Also works with smartphone IMUs and prerecorded OpenROV data.
